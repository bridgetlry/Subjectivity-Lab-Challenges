                    My name is Bridget Leary, and I am a rising third-year 
                    Computer Science and Cognitive Psychology major at Northeastern
                    University. I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois and moved
                    out to Boston for college. I will be a Research Assistant at the
                    Subjectivity Lab this fall, and I am very excited to begin working.
